We also each agree as follows:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">"Disputes" are any claims (including the definition of "claims" contained in the section Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranty above) or controversies against each other related in any way to this Agreement, the Terms of Use, the Privacy Statement, or Your purchase and use of the Product.

Notice to You will be sent to Your billing address that You provided Us and notice to Us will be sent to: My Wedding Connector, 7295 Dr. Garrison Road, Mansfield, TX 76063. We each agree to make attempts to resolve this dispute within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the notice to arbitrate, then We may submit the dispute to formal arbitration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">The FAA applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. We each agree that the FAA\'s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">The arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration Forum ("NAF") under its arbitration rules. If any NAF rule conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement apply. You can obtain procedures, rules, and fee information from the NAF at 1-800-474-2371 or www.adrforum.com.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">Unless We each agree otherwise, the Arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and will take place in the state of Your last billing address. The federal or state law that applies to the Agreement will also apply during the Arbitration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">We each agree not to pursue arbitration on a consolidated or classwide basis. We each agree that any arbitration will be solely between You and My Wedding Connector (not brought on behalf of or together with another individual\'s claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator hold that this restriction in unconscionable or unenforceable, then this agreement to arbitrate does not apply and the dispute must be brought in court.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">We each are responsible for our own costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses, as well as any other costs relating to the arbitration.
